# OS_3 : Semaphore

- The same as the second project, but with the coordination of threads with the help of semaphore
- All threads share a data structure for best results.
-  All running threads share their best result in a common data structure
- While the threads are working, as soon as a better result is obtained, the result is printed by the parent.
- Using the readers/writers method
-  Not using busy waiting
